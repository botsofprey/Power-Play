/*This teleop is for when the robot begins on the left/blue square-ish thing (audience
orentation)and is trying to go to the left same colored ?storage? (idk man whatever scores the
points)
 *//*
thought process
scan qr code
pick up THE cone
score it or just bring it with you to the storage triangle thing
     (if scoring prolly on the medium or low or even ground junction)
reverse back to the original starting position
go left into the half square
wait til the drivers drive around
ta-da all done

//but you should ignore this because its prolly wrong
